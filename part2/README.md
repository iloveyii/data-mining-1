## Description

Create a Data Mining task of your own to analyze a dataset provided to you. In this task, you shall learn about Frequent Item Mining (FIM) algorithms. The general theory of the algorithms was discussed during the lectures. You shall use available open source libraries or write Python codes of your own to analyze the data. If you use the available libraries, you may have to customize the code to meet your requirements.
