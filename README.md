# Objective
In this lab, you shall
1. Learn how to use Cloud Computing for your Data Mining tasks
2. Familiarize yourself with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
3. Experiment with Frequent Item Mining (FIM)

In order to perform the experiments in this lab, you need a reliable Internet connection.
There will be a tutorial session to help you get started.

# Procedure
  * Once enrolled in the Cloud environment, read tutorials available online to understand how machine learning and data mining tasks can be executed on the Cloud.
  * Create a Data Mining task of your own to analyze a dataset provided to you. In this task, you shall learn about Frequent Item Mining (FIM) algorithms. The general theory of the algorithms was discussed during the lectures. You shall use available open source libraries or write Python codes of your own to analyze the data. If you use the available libraries, you may have to customize the code to meet your requirements.
  * Produce a regression model for the given dataset. You may use Octave, Matlab or another tool (Python based). Compare and evaluate different regression models. Which type of model is recommended? Why?



# Report
   * You shall write a report on what you learned in using GCP for machine learning applications (part1).
   * Write a report on how you solved the task in Part2 and Part3. Upload your solution code together with your report (in separate files).
