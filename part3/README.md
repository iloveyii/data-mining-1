## Description

Produce a regression model for the given dataset. You may use Octave, Matlab or another tool (Python based). Compare and evaluate different regression models. Which type of model is recommended? Why?


## Installations
  * Clone the repository `https://www.github.com/iloveyii/data-mining-1/`.
  * CD to the repository `cd task3`.
  * Create a virtual environment `python3 -m venv venv`.
  * Source environment variables `source venv/bin/activate`.
  * Install the required packages `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
  
  
## Run
  * Run the script as
    `python3.6 exploratory_analysis.py`
    `python3.6 task3.py`
  * Using Jupyter for this task is recommended. Open and run exploratory_analysis.ipynb and task3.ipynb
  
## Result
  * Multi variable regression gives much better accuracy.
